HTTP::CryptoCookie version 1.10
=========================

HTTP::CryptoCookie provides a method for the secure storage and
transmitting of any perl data structure (except coderefs or other
objects, as are the normal restrictions for FreezeThaw).

The structure is frozen, compressed, encrypted, then ASCII-armoured
and finally sent to the browser.  The order reverses itself when
a cookie is read.

Multiple cookies may be sent simultaneously.  This module was
originally created for use under mod_perl and has been used under
both HTML::Mason and Template::Toolkit.

READ THE POD DOCUMENTATION.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

The tests use the following data structure:

my $struct = {
        foo  => 'bar',
        sing => [qw(do re me fa so la ti da)],
        sung => {
                one => 1,
                two => 2,
        },
        blargh => [1..25],
};

On a 1.2GHz PPC (Mac OS X 10.4.X iBook) the average time to set this cookie
(not including the transmit to the HTTP client) is between 4ms and 5.5ms
(depending on what else the machine is doing).  Yes, Virginia, despite the
numerous steps this module takes, it *is* fast.  Expect much faster
performance on relatively recent hardware.

I've run it on x86, PPC, and SPARC.  You should have no portability issues,
even when setting the cookie on one architecture and reading the cookie
on another.
